First approach to OOP and package. 

I created the cats package and the Cat interface. The interface is implemented by the TigerDreamer, Pussyfoot, Catacrobat, Scrapper and Twofoot classes. The Catthulhu class imports the package and returns the peculiar actions of each cat

```java 
Catthulhu.java Catacrobat Pussyfoot Scrapper Tiger Twofoot
```
